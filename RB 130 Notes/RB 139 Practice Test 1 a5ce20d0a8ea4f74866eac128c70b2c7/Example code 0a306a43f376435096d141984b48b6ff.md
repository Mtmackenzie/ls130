# Example code

```ruby
# Passing blocks to methods as an implicit argument

# # Normal block passed to method as implicit argument
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block { puts "hello" } # => output: hello, return: "hi"

# # Normal method that takes a block but isn't provided one
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block # => LocalJumpError

# # How to fix LocalJumpError
# def normal_block
#   yield if block_given?
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block # => returns: "hi"

# # Passing an argument to a block
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block

# # Blocks have more lenient arity than methods
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block

# # Variable shadowing
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block

# # Blocks have return value and can mutate the argument
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block # => 

# # Use case 1 for blocks: defer implementation to method invocation time
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block # => 

# # Use case 2 for blocks: sandwich code
# def normal_block
#   yield
#   "hi"
# end
# normal_block # => 

# Pass blocks to method as an explicit argument
# - Ruby converts blocks passed in as explicit arguments to simple Proc objects
# - benefit of passing as explicit argument: now that it is stored in a container, it is reusable

# # Version 1
# def simple_proc(&proc)
#   "Simple proc: #{proc}" # => "Simple proc: #<Proc:0x000055921c7b7970@solution.rb:7>"
# end
# p simple_proc { "hello" }
  
# # Version 2
# def simple_proc_call(&proc)
#   "Simple proc: #{proc.call}" # => "Simple proc: hello"
# end
# p simple_proc_call { "hello" }
    
# Version 3
def other_method(something)
  yield(something.call)
end

def simple_proc(&other)
  other_method(other) { |el| puts (el + " hi") }
  proc
end

simple_proc("other") { "hello" } # => "hello"
